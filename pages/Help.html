            Year 4 (addition and subtraction) randomly generated numbers between 1 and 80. 
            Year 5 (addition and subtraction) randomly generates numbers between 1 and 200 Year 5 (multiplication and division) randomly generates numbers between 5 and 13.
            Year 6 (addition and subtraction) randomly generates numbers between 1 and 600 Year 6 (multiplication and division) randomly generates numbers between 1 and 20.

            Once you have selected the year which best suits you, you can choose your level which can increase or decrease the difficulty of the game, or the learn button where you get example equations to help learn the maths faster.
            If you select to play the game, you will get to choose from a selection of puzzles.  Once one is selected, it will take you to the game play page.
